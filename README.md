# Week-3-Challenge

# PyBank:
# First, import os and csv
# Then choose file's location as the same location of the main.py file. 
# Then open file with "read" attribute, with a delimiter of ','
# After that, skip the first row using next(csvreader)
# After that, create empty lists for month_count, profit, and profit_change
# Use a for loop throughout all row to append both the month_count and the profit lists
# Then find maximum increase and maximum decreagse values for the profit_change list
# Then find out the index values for both of the values above
# Print the values found above as shown in the main.py file
# Use "len" for total votes to find total months
# Createe a new file called "output.txt in the "analysis" folder
# Write a new line for each of the values printed above using "\n" code


# PyPol:
# First, import os and csv
# Then choose file's location as the same location of the main.py file. 
# Then open file with "read" attribute, with a delimiter of ','
# After that, skip the first row using next(csvreader)
# Create empty lists for total votes, candidates and unique candidates
# Use a for loop to loop through all rows in the csv file and append both total votes and candidates lists
# After that, loop through the candidates list populated above, and populate the "unique_cadidates" list if value from "candidcates" is not already in "unique_cadidates" 
# Find out total votes for all three candidates by using the '.count' attribute
# Then define a new variable "winner" and equate it to the first candidate
# Use if loops to find the maximum number of votes and set that to variable "winner"
# Print values found above as shown in the main.py file
# Use "len" for total votes to find the total votes
# Createe a new file called "output.txt in the "analysis" folder
# Write a new line for each of the values printed above using "\n" code
